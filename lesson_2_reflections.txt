What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, git creates a '.git' file in that directory. You need this file to start making commits. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate between the working directory and repository. It lets you check and make sure you know what you are committing before you do it.
