When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would use a remote repository when I want to share my work with others or have it accessible from the web.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the changes that I commit might not solve the entire problem, or introduce all of a new concept. It would be really hard for people to understand if they were looking at my remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are used when you want to make a new series of commits based on a new feature or idea. Clones are used when you want to copy someone's repository to your computer. Forks are just GitHub clones. They operate on GitHub, and insure that the right people get the right credit.
